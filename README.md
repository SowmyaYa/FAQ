# FAQ
These are the user stories of the features I have added to the project.

1. As a FAQ app user I want to Mark the answer correct so that I can validate the answer posted.

Steps to follow: Login into the app and click "Create a Question" link. A question form opens where you can write your question and submit. Once the question is submitted, a view button is available, clicking on this button shows the user his/her question along with a "Answer Question" button. Upon clicking "Answer Question" button, the user will be directed to the Answer where he/she can write the answer and post it. Once the answer is posted, a "View" button is displayed along with the answer, Click "View" button and user will be directed to the answer page which has a "Correct" button. User can click this "Correct" button to validate his/her answer.	
Working: Works Perfectly

2. As a FAQ app user I want to View the logging of my app so that I can see how many errors I have faced while navigating through the app.	

Steps to follow: Works perfectly fine in the local host and only frontend can be shown on heroku as heroku doesnot have the capability to store data and heroku is ephimeral. Go to the FAQ app using the link:                "http://localhost:8000" and click "LOG VIEWER" link. This opens a Dashboard which shows the user the number of errors faced by him/her.
Front end can be viewed by going to the FAQ app using the link:                "https://faqproje1.herokuapp.com" and click "LOG VIEWER" link. This opens the Dashboard.

4. As a Examiner/Developer of project I want to Run Dusk tests so that I can validate the correctness of my program(app).

I have written 5 dusk tests with 25 assertions. All of them are working without failures. I have commited the code. These tests can be found in my github repository.	Works Perfectly. I have sent the Screenshot of my dusktests and full user stories to Professor.
